# Inventory Management practise with UiPath

This project was made to solidify my knowledge about UiPath and RPA in general.
The project exercise idea was borrowed from https://excelcult.com/rpachallengeseries/ called 'Inventory Management'

# About the robot
This robot gets all PDF data from Data folder and inserts/updates/deletes data in https://excelcult.com/inventorymanagement/
After that, the robot takes the screenshot of the data left in the browser.
